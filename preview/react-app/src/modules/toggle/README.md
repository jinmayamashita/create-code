# Toggle

A toggle feature is a function in a software application that allows a user to switch between two different states or options. It is often represented by a button or switch that can be turned on or off, and it can be used to enable or disable certain features or settings. For example, a toggle feature in a word processing program might be used to turn on or off the ability to track changes made to a document.
